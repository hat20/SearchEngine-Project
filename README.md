# SearchEngine-Project-Completed-(Beginner Level)

There's really not much to explain about this project, open the project and read the code, it is all explained in there as to what I've done.
I've made this project and learnt python along the way and I do not own any content.

Language used - <b>Python v2.6</b>


P.S - The Search engine made isn't really efficient and is only for learning purposes.
However, this search engine actually works but is not very efficient and works on a very small scale and I'd be working on another project where I'll be optimising it.
